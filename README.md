# PennVR Fireworks Demo

This demo is based on Threejs [PointerLockControls sample](https://threejs.org/examples/?q=pointer#misc_controls_pointerlock) and draws heavily upon the [CustomAttributePoints sample(https://threejs.org/examples/?q=point#webgl_custom_attributes_points).

I also reviewed some basics for interacting with GLSL in Three.js [here](https://aerotwist.com/tutorials/an-introduction-to-shaders-part-2/).
